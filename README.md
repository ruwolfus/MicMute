MicMute is a small program that will enable you to easily manage the level of a connected microphone. The application also supports push-to-talk thanks to the built-in 'Transmitter Mode'. While it runs minimized in the system tray, MicMute? can be controlled trough keyboard shortcuts you choose. The software uses tray notification balloons and it also has a sound signal option you can activate.
